# Changes Summary: BIN and Auction Separation

## Files Modified

### 1. `luxury_sniper.py`
- **Replaced single scraping function** with two separate functions:
  - `scrape_yahoo_luxury_bin()` - Scrapes Buy It Now listings using `auccat=0`
  - `scrape_yahoo_luxury_auctions()` - Scrapes auction listings using `auccat=auction`
- **Updated main loop** to search both types separately:
  - Phase 1: BIN listings (higher priority)
  - Phase 2: Auction listings
- **Added listing type tracking** with `listing_type` field
- **Updated webhook URL** to use `/webhook/listing` endpoint
- **Enhanced logging** with BIN/Auction phase indicators

### 2. `luxury_discord_bot.py`
- **Added new channel constant**: `BIN_CHANNEL_NAME = "ðŸ’Ž-buyitnow"`
- **Updated channel creation** to create both channels:
  - `#ðŸ’Ž-luxury-under-60` for auctions
  - `#ðŸ’Ž-buyitnow` for Buy It Now items
- **Enhanced embed styling** with different emojis and footers:
  - BIN: ðŸ›’ emoji, "Buy It Now - Instant purchase!"
  - Auction: ðŸ”¨ emoji, "Auction - Place your bid!"
- **Implemented smart routing** in `send_luxury_batch_if_ready()`:
  - Routes listings to correct channels based on `listing_type`
- **Updated webhook handling** to support both listing types
- **Enhanced stats command** to show both channels
- **Updated reaction handling** to work with both channels

## New Files Created

### 3. `test_luxury_integration.py`

- **Tests health endpoints** for both scraper and Discord bot
- **Tests webhook functionality** for both BIN and auction listings
- **Provides detailed feedback** and troubleshooting information

### 4. `README_LUXURY_UPDATE.md`
- **Complete documentation** of the new system
- **Configuration instructions** and environment variables
- **Troubleshooting guide** and common issues
- **Future enhancement ideas** and roadmap

### 5. `start_luxury_services.sh`
- **Automated startup script** for both services
- **Environment variable validation** and setup
- **Process management** with proper cleanup
- **Health monitoring** and status reporting

## Key Features Implemented

### ðŸ”„ Dual Scraping Strategy
- **BIN Priority**: Searches Buy It Now listings first (instant purchase)
- **Auction Coverage**: Then searches auction listings (bidding required)
- **Separate Filtering**: Uses Yahoo's built-in category parameters
- **Type Tagging**: Each item gets proper `listing_type` classification

### ðŸ“º Smart Channel Routing
- **Automatic Routing**: Listings go to correct channels based on type
- **Visual Distinction**: Different emojis and styling for each type
- **User Experience**: Clear separation of purchase methods
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallback if channels aren't available

### ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced Visual Design
- **BIN Listings**: ðŸ›’ shopping cart emoji, instant purchase messaging
- **Auction Listings**: ðŸ”¨ hammer emoji, bidding instructions
- **Brand Emojis**: Maintained luxury brand-specific styling
- **Quality Indicators**: Deal quality scoring for both types

## Technical Improvements

### Performance
- **Parallel Processing**: Both listing types processed in same cycle
- **Efficient Filtering**: Yahoo's server-side filtering reduces data transfer
- **Smart Batching**: Maintains existing batch processing for Discord

### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Separate error handling for each scraping function
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation if one type fails
- **Health Monitoring**: Enhanced health endpoints for both services

### Maintainability
- **Clear Separation**: Each function has a single responsibility
- **Consistent Logging**: Structured logging for both BIN and auction phases
- **Modular Design**: Easy to modify or extend individual components

## Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables
```bash
# New/Updated variables
USE_DISCORD_BOT=true                    # Enable Discord integration
DISCORD_BOT_URL=http://localhost:8002   # Discord bot endpoint
MAX_PRICE_USD=60                       # Maximum price filter
MIN_PRICE_USD=0.50                     # Minimum price filter
```

### Port Configuration
- **Luxury Scraper**: Port 8003 (unchanged)
- **Discord Bot**: Port 8002 (updated from 8000)
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `/webhook/listing` (unified endpoint)

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Discord bot health and channel creation
